Write a function that, given the dataset and the ID of an individual in the dataset, returns their earliest known ancestor â€“ the one at the farthest distance from the input individual. If there is more than one ancestor tied for "earliest", return the one with the lowest numeric ID. If the input individual has no parents, the function should return -1.

    PROBLEM: I need to determine all of the earliest ancestors for any starting node if I'm given a list of ancestors. In this case, the correct earliest ancestor is the item in the list which is furthest back in the chain and the smallest possible numeric id.
    
    SOLUTION: I think a dictionary would work well here. I could populate a dictionary with all of the values from the tuples with the key being a child node and the values being a list of possible parent nodes.

    I begin by populating the dictionary with my parent:child pairs. Once I have my dictionary populated, I should have a data structure I can reference easily. 
    
    We can start with the original starting item and then compare that value to the values in the dictionary.
        1) If the starting value is already in a parent dict and not in a child dict, we should return -1 
            because there isn't an earlier ancestor to be found.
            
        2) If the starting value is in the child dict, we can choose to only pick the minimum value from our 
            child_dict, so we throw that value onto the stack and use that as the current_node.
                
        3) If the starting value is ONLY in the parent dict after we've already started our traversal, we know 
            that
