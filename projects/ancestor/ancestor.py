    PROBLEM: I need to determine all of the earliest ancestors for any starting node if I'm given a list of ancestors. In this case, the correct earliest ancestor is the item in the list which is furthest back in the chain and the smallest possible numeric id.
    
    SOLUTION: I think a dictionary would work well here. I could populate two dictionaries: One with nodes which are children, one with nodes which are parents.
    
    We can begin with the original starting_item and then compare that value to the values in the dictionary.
    
        1) If the starting value is in a parent dict and NOT in a child dict, we should return -1 
            because there isn't an earlier ancestor to be found.
            
            1a) At this point, we have passed one of our first conditions and should set a current_node to that starting node. The current_node will change as we progress through our data structure.
            
        2) If the current_node is in the child dict, this means that we aren't where we want to be just yet. We 
            know we need to traverse further up the tree. We can select the minimum value from our 
            child_dict[current_node] since this is going to return a list of up to 2 elements. We throw that minimum value onto the stack and use that as the current_node.
                
        3) If the current_value is ONLY in the parent dict after we've already started our traversal, we know 
            that we've reached the earliest ancestor. At this point, we can return that current_node.
