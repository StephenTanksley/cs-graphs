"""

Write a function that, given the dataset and the ID of an individual in the dataset, returns their earliest known ancestor â€“ the one at the farthest distance from the input individual. If there is more than one ancestor tied for "earliest", return the one with the lowest numeric ID. If the input individual has no parents, the function should return -1.

If we wanted the earliest ancestor of 9, we'd traverse up the graph to find 8. From 8, there would be two possible ancestor vertices (4 and 11). We'd keep track of both 4 and 11. If neither 4 nor 11 have any earlier ancestors, we return the ancestor with the lower numeric id (4).

    PROBLEM: I need to determine all of the earliest ancestors for any starting node if I'm given a list of ancestors. In this case, the correct earliest ancestor is the item in the list which is furthest back in the chain and the smallest possible numeric id.
    
    SOLUTION: I think a dictionary would work well here. I could populate a dictionary with all of the values from the tuples with the key being a child node and the values being a list of possible parent nodes.

    I begin by populating the dictionary with my parent:child pairs. Once I have my dictionary populated, I should have a data structure I can reference easily. We can start with
